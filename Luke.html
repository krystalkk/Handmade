        A cheerful attitude is the outstanding trait of the Bichon's personality.<br> This dog loves to be loved, enjoys being the center of attention,and is adept at charming his family, neighbors, groomer, <br>or veterinarian with his winning personality.<br>

The Bichon has a playful, independent streak, but that doesn't mean he likes to be alone. <br>In fact, this breed hates being alone and commonly suffers from separation anxiety if left alone for many hours.<br> In such situations, Bichons may become destructive, chewing and tearing up anything in sight.<br> Obviously the Bichon is not a breed of choice for people who are away from home for long periods of time (indeed, no dog is).<br>

The highly intelligent Bichon needs to be taught proper canine manners, so it's essential to sign up for obedience training, beginning with puppy classes. <br>Bichons are quick studies, so taking them to such classes can be very satisfying. They're also good at tricks and some canine sports.<br>
